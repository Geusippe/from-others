# Son Of War Mod
 A content mod for Uniciv that takes a turn towards fantasy.

Current Features:
- Six unique civilizations, each with its own unique units, buildings, and strategy.
- New units, such as the buildable "Prophet" unit that can start a golden age when expended.
- A fully separate gameplay experience from the standard Uniciv due to a complete override of the default nations.

Planned Features:
- Many more civilizations.
- More buildings.
- Tech tree overhaul.
- Magical tech-tree path.

Suggestions are welcome, although the worldbuilding aspects (such as nations and their units) have already been designed after being used for another game.
